				Many years ago Dermot and Lauren met for the first time. What would come from this was a flurry of inside jokes and special bonds. One joke developed from the notion they would unite and form a cake shop (despite the fact that one member of the duo didn't like cake!) This joke expanded to include the idea that, since the pair were an ocean apart, they would need to find a place inbetween where they could set up shop: right in the middle of the ocean of course! 
			</p>

			<p>
				With the love between them, the cake as their goal, and the ocean as their setting a title was found for the unique establishment: <em>All You Need Is Love, Cake, And Oceans.</em> And while the store would remain a dream in their hearts, the trip that is coming up shall be a lived out version of this dreamy idea.
			</p>

			<p>
				With the experiences embraced seen as Love, and with the food shared seen as the Cake, the explored settings would be the Oceans. On January 10th, the two can live out the true spirit of the playful joke between them even if they don't live it out literally. But it will be perfect, <em>because it will be real!</em>
